## Hi there 👋
# Welcome to my Github Profile💃💃 

### About Me
Hii👋🙋‍♂️👋 name is Adedokun, Yusroh Aderayo, mostly referred to as <em>Derayo</em>, i'm a first-year student of the prestigious 🎓University of Ilorin, Ilorin, Kwara , Nigeria, studying Information Technology.
<p> I'm a passionate techie😊 and a avid volunteer, my hobbies include:</p>
<ol>
    <li>📖Reading novels</li>
    <li>🥳Attending tech events</li>
    <li>🤩Learning new things</li>
</ol>

### My tech life (Code)
My dream is to be a software developer👩‍💻 and over the years i've been studying frontend development, sadly i have not found my footing yet, i have learned HTML, CSS and i keep getting stucked at JavaScript over and over again😔🙍‍♀️.

### My tech life (No-Code)
Confused...? Don't be, while joinning different tech communities i got to learn about the NoCode aspect of tech and i delved into it and it's quite interesting.
<p> Currently, i work as a Content writer for a startup and by the side i'm learning Technical writing</p>
<p> As much as i find writing intresting, i still want to learn coding extensively </p>
